Communication
Throughout the project, our team prioritized open and frequent communication to ensure everyone was aligned and issues were resolved quickly. We held regular stand-up meetings a few times a week to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps. We used Whatsapp for quick questions and updates, which helped us avoid misunderstandings and kept everyone in the loop.
For example, when integrating the frontend React app with the Django backend, the frontend and backend developers coordinated closely to define the API endpoints and data formats. We used shared API documentation to agree on request/response structures, which minimized integration bugs.
We also used GitHub for version control, and every pull request required at least one team member to review it. This not only improved code quality but also ensured that everyone was aware of changes happening in the codebase.

Feedback : 
 We actively sought and incorporated feedback at every stage of the project. During development, we set up a staging environment where team members could test new features before they went live. We encouraged each other to try out new UI components or API endpoints and give honest feedback on usability and functionality.
For instance, after implementing the restaurant review feature, we asked a few non-developer friends to use the app and leave reviews. Their feedback led us to simplify the review submission process and add clearer error messages.
We also used automated tests and manual QA to catch issues early. Whenever a bug was found, we discussed it as a team, identified the root cause, and quickly pushed a fix. Regular sprint retrospectives allowed us to reflect on what was working and what could be improved, so our process evolved based on real experiences.
