## XP Core Values

**Communication:**
Open and effective communication was the backbone of our project. We maintained clear channels through daily stand-ups, GitHub issues, and a shared task board, ensuring everyone was aligned. Frequent check-ins helped us avoid silos and kept all team members aware of project progress and blockers. Clear documentation and prompt updates on Slack ensured smooth handoffs between frontend, backend, and cloud teams. By fostering transparent communication, we were able to catch bugs early, prioritize tasks efficiently, and maintain strong team synergy from start to finish.

**Courage:**
Our team demonstrated courage by embracing challenges head-on and adapting to change throughout the development process. Whether it was refactoring large sections of code, overhauling our search filter logic, or taking on unfamiliar tech stacks for deployment, we made bold decisions to improve the product. For example, midway through development, we identified flaws in the existing database schema. Rather than building on top of a weak foundation, we had the courage to redesign itâ€”even though it meant reworking some of the APIs. This decision ultimately resulted in a more robust and scalable architecture. Team members were encouraged to voice concerns and suggest improvements, even if it meant rethinking initial ideas.
